    "readme": "# vega-projection\n\nProjections for cartographic mapping.\n\nThis module provides a [projection](#projection) method for managing\nregistered cartographic projections. By default, the projection registry\nincludes all projection types provided by the [d3-geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo) module.\n\n## API Reference\n\n<a name=\"projection\" href=\"#projection\">#</a>\nvega.<b>projection</b>(<i>type</i>[, <i>projection</i>])\n[<>](https://github.com/vega/vega-projection/blob/master/src/projections.js \"Source\")\n\nRegistry function for adding and accessing projection constructor functions.\nThe *type* argument is a String indicating the name of the projection type.\nIf the *projection* argument is not specified, this method returns the\nmatching projection constructor in the registry, or `null` if not found.\nIf the *projection* argument is provided, it must be a projection constructor\nfunction to add to the registry under the given *type* name.\n\nBy default, the projection registry includes entries for all projection types\nprovided by the [d3-geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo) module.\nProjections created using the constructor returned by this method are\naugmented with the following additional properties:\n\n- `type`: A string value indicating the projection type.\n- `path`: A D3 [geoPath](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#geoPath) instance configured to use the projection. When using this path instance, be sure to set the [path context](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo#path_context) as needed.\n- `copy`: A zero-argument function the produces a copy of the projection.\n\n\n```js\n// mercator projection\nvar mercator = vega.projection('mercator');\nvar proj = mercator().translate([400, 200]);\nscale.type; // 'mercator'\nscale([0, 0]); // [400, 200] center point\n```\n",
